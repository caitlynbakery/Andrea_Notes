# Basic Functions

Topics to Learn:

* positional arguments
* lexical scope
* inner functions
* global mutable state
* pure functions

## Argument vs Parameter

Function arguments are the value of the variables that are passed to the function.
Parameters are the variables defined at function declaration.

Function names are typically verbs while function parameters are nouns.

## Functions with Named arguments

Without Null Safety, arguments can be omitted and have a null value.
The null value may cause your program to break.

With Null Safety, there are three ways to handle function parameters.

1. make arguments nullable (ex: `{String? name}`)
2. make arguments non-nullable
    * use default value(ex: `{String name = 'Caitlyn'}`)
    * mark the argument as required(ex: `{required String name}`)

## Local & Global Scope

### Local Scope

Scope is block of code defined inside curly braces. It can contain multiple statements.
Variables defined inside the scope can't be accessed outside of the scope.

```dart
const a = 10;
  print(a);
  
  if(a > 5) {
    const a = 5;
    print(a);
  }
```

### Global Scope

Global scope is a variable that is assigned outside of the main function and can be accessed anywhere in the code.

```dart
const global = 15;

void main(){
    print(global);
}
```

## Global Mutable State

Global mutable state can lead to bugs and issues that cost a lot of time to fix.

A side effect is when a variable is modified outside of its scope.
The side effect is really bad because you don't want to change the variable in
another scope!

```dart
var counter = 1;

void main() {
    counter++;
    counter++;
}
```

In the example above, the global variable counter is being modified which we should avoid.
